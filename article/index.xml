      <description>One of the major benefits of Atomic Red Team is that it enables security teams to understand how adversaries leverage MITRE® ATT&amp;amp;CK techniques in the real world, and I’ve been a big fan for years. To me, Atomic Red Team is more than a repository of tests (aka atomics), it’s also a knowledge base, training tool, and more.
Each atomic in the library simulates a known adversary behavior associated with a given technique.</description>

      <description>Today, Swimlane is excited to announce that we are releasing a new SSP (Swimlane Solutions Package) for use within the Swimlane platform. This SSP will enable organizations to automate the testing of their defenses using Atomic Red Team using our new open-source project called atomic-operator.
When using this SSP organizations can gain an understanding of their defensive posture against tests mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK techniques. By using this use case you can correlate detections of these tests against their existing automation and log sources thus giving them fast feedback on their defensive posture based on tests available within Atomic Red Team.</description>

      <description>When it comes to implementing automation and orchestration, it is critical to understand how authentication works with APIs. The majority of the products in your environment likely have some sort of authentication mechanism. You need to know the nuances and differences between various authentication methods in order to automate communications with those APIs. In this blog post, I aim to help you understand by breaking down three different API authentication methods.</description>

      <description>MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK is the defacto framework for organizations to measure their defense posture. ATT&amp;amp;CK provides categorical verticals in the form of tactics, which align to the common methodologies attackers use. Within these verticals are a set (and subsets) of common ways in which attackers accomplish a tactic (vertical). These are known as techniques.
Some techniques may be common across multiple operating systems. This usually equates to a broad definition of a technique.</description>

      <guid>https://letsautomate.it/article/responding-to-insider-threats-with-soar/</guid>
      <description>Insider threats occur when an individual with ties to an organization misuses their access for malicious intent, such as stealing intellectual property or other data. Detecting insider threats can be difficult. But by using a security information and event management (SIEM) system or data loss prevention (DLP) products, you can create alerts to detect the exfiltration of data leaving your organization that is unauthorized or unexpected.
Once you have detected these events, your security operations center (SOC) needs to investigate rapidly.</description>

      <guid>https://letsautomate.it/article/identify-malicious-domains-using-soar/</guid>
      <description>Domain Squatting, typosquatting and IDN homograph attacks are commonplace when it comes to phishing and other forms of social engineering. Attackers use domain squatting and typosquatting of domains to trick users into providing their credentials, distribute malware, harm an organization’s reputation, or otherwise maliciously impersonate a legitimate domain. We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed this topic before and have developed a unique use case with Swimlane to detect this malicious activity automatically.
Recently, we began to monitor domains related to coronavirus (COVID-19), knowing there would be an increase in traffic to research the outbreak, which could be exploited by bad actors.</description>

      <description>Today is the day. Microsoft Windows 7 is officially end-of-life (EOL). The Windows 7 operating system was released on October 22, 2009. For 10 years now, IT and system administrators around the globe have relied on their trusty old Windows 7 OS. I mean, it was a step beyond Windows XP for sure. With EOL here, have you migrated all of your systems to Windows 10?
If you have not migrated, you definitely should.</description>

      <guid>https://letsautomate.it/article/investigate-alerts-in-microsoft-azure-using-soar/</guid>
      <description>Alerts or detections come in many forms—some are good and some are not—and security operations center (SOC) analysts are responsible for the initial investigation into these anomalies. What’s more, when it comes to cloud-based resources, we may not have the luxury of logging everything that happens on a host operating system.
Microsoft Azure helps provide quite a bit of data to assist with the initial investigation, as well as some initial response actions.</description>

      <description>In my previous post, I talked about the basics of REST (representable state transfer) APIs (application programming interfaces). If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it yet, I highly recommend you read that post before continuing.
In this post, we will be talking about the basics of simple object access protocol (SOAP) APIs, and we will primarily focus on a real SOAP service: Microsoft Exchange Web Services. RESTful APIs, which are the most commonly used APIs today, are powerful and provide a simple way to interact with a service or application via an exposed interface.</description>

      <guid>https://letsautomate.it/article/understanding-apis-rest/</guid>
      <description>Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) platforms rely heavily on APIs (application programming interfaces) to drive orchestration of disparate security tools (products) and invoke desired responses in the form of actions. Besides SOAR products, APIs are commonplace among almost all services, tools, and products used by technical workers.
Even though APIs are extremely common, you may not have experience using them or even know that a service has one when interacting with it.</description>

      <guid>https://letsautomate.it/article/vulnerability-management-program-best-practices/</guid>
      <description>Nowadays most organizations have begun to implement a Vulnerability Management Program (VMP), but implementing one is daunting. Most organizations realize they either have no true categorical ownership over systems or they lack the authority to enforce remediation of identified vulnerabilities. Either way, it is time consuming to track down and enforce a true VMP within many organizations.
What is a Vulnerability Management Program? If you are new to implementing a VMP, then you first must understand what vulnerability management is.</description>

      <guid>https://letsautomate.it/article/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-detection-queries/</guid>
      <description>Recently, I shared on Twitter how you could run a query to detect if a user has clicked on a link within their Outlook using Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (MDATP). If you are not familiar, MDATP is available within your Microsoft 365 E5 license and is an enhancement to the traditional Windows Defender you might be used to.
What is Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection? Microsoft says that “Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection is a platform designed to help enterprise networks prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced threats.</description>

      <description>As security teams adopt the Mitre ATT&amp;amp;CK Framework to help them identify gaps in their defenses, having a way to identify what malware and tools are being used by specific actors or groups becomes more critical. Additionally, having a way to identify these relationships programatically is even more critical.
Today, we are excited to announce the Swimlane research team has released pyattck — a Python package to interact with the Mitre ATT&amp;amp;CK Framework.</description>

      <description>DevOps, serverless applications and containers are just a few of the latest advancements in a developer&amp;rsquo;s toolbox. For development teams, this means that the time to market (TTM) is faster—especially for Agile teams. So, how and what are security operations teams doing to ensure that security is keeping pace with this rapid development? Most are attempting to incorporate a security engineer within their development teams—which is a great first step—but there are multiple layers that you need to ensure you are protecting your organization beyond your source-code.</description>

      <description>We all know that security operations (SecOps) teams are overwhelmed by the extreme number of alerts they receive on a daily basis. Organizations are being attacked from all fronts, whether they know it or not. These attacks vary from social engineering, malicious emails, vulnerable services and applications, misconfiguration (job fatigue), etc.
Traditionally in a security operations center (SOC), malware analysis—more specifically reverse engineering—is conducted by a highly trained member of the security team (depending on your size, this may be multiple individuals).</description>

      <description>I posted a tweet earlier this week asking if anyone would be interested in a small series of posts that explain the differences between Python and PowerShell.
So, here we go!
Python on macOS Python and PowerShell are quite a bit different from each other. Python has been around for several years and works on multiple operating systems. Additionally, Python is beloved by it&amp;rsquo;s extremely supportive open-source community; rightfully so! Python is fast and portable, and is a go to for most developers.</description>

      <description>Simple Notification Service (SNS) from Amazon Web Services (AWS) can work in conjunction with AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS), Lambda Functions, HTTP APIs/endpoints, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Simple Storage Service (S3), and so on. As PowerShell continues to gain attraction with IT professionals around the globe, you can use SNS along with other services to create powerful applications to help your business win.
Amazon SNS lets your application deliver notifications to additional services or applications, depending on your use case.</description>

      <description>I recently transitioned my blog over to GitHub Pages from WordPress. I was using the free version from WordPress.org and I wanted more granular control over the layout. Additionally, I wanted to automate my blog publishing and social media notifications; the free version of WordPress didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my needs. So I looked around and eventually fell in love with Hugo! This post outlines how to go about setting up a GitHub Pages website/blog using Hugo.</description>

      <description>Amazon SQS is a flexible queue service that has many uses cases, from scalable web applications and processing systems to inter-application communications. This is useful if you need to process lots of data at once or have threads or workers to do a specific action to a large pool of data.
With the explosion of use cases for PowerShell and Docker in production systems, you can easily scale using queue systems like Amazon SQS.</description>

      <description>Windows Certificate Store is typically accessed using the MMC Snap-In, You can view both the Computer or User certificate stores using a traditional MMC console. Sometimes though, you may just want to programmatically access it using PowerShell. Luckily you can do this using a PSDrive that is created on your machine.
As you can see there is a Cert drive and you can access it using PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s multiple location based Cmdlets.</description>

      <description>PowerShell is unique, but it is also necessary in today&amp;rsquo;s world. I find that newcomers to the language are sometimes confused or don&amp;rsquo;t understand the basic layers of PowerShell scripting. You can use PowerShell in different ways, but I have yet to find an all encompassing article that explains the high-level of how to interact with PowerShell in these different ways.
This post will explain the different concepts (or layers) of PowerShell code organization and their main advantages and use cases.</description>

      <description>I am currently migrating my blog content from Wordpress.com to GitHub pages using Hugo. During this transition, I wanted to have the ability to &amp;ldquo;revive&amp;rdquo; my blog posts on a scheduled basis on social media (e.g. Twitter). With Wordpress, you can use the WordPress Revive Old Posts plugin but with WordPress.com you have to have a premium business account to use plugins.
If you&amp;rsquo;re in a similar situation of if you want a free way to automate the &amp;ldquo;re-posting&amp;rdquo; of your blog content then you&amp;rsquo;re in luck!</description>

      <description>In my previous two posts we created a knowledge base of questions and answers using QnAMaker and we created our Web App Bot in the Azure Portal. Now that we have a bot created and it is responding as we intended, we can interact with our bot directly through our web browser (or embed it into a website) or we can integrate into our Slack workspace.
Please make sure you have a Slack workspace created and you have access to create a Slack application.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was asked to help with streamling a manual process that some QA folks were running into. They had a debug release of an applicaiton that was signed with a test code signing certificate. Part of the process was that they needed to select a DLL, view the certificate, and then install the certificate into the machines trusted certificate store.
This is a extremely simple task, but it was just an annoyance, so I wrote a few lines of code to autoamte this for them.</description>

That presentation will be about a PowerShell Module I have built called PSLogging, which is a logging framework built using PowerShell Classes.</description>

      <description>The easiest way to create an ADMX template is to build an ADM template first and then convert the latter with the help of Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s free ADMX Migrator tool.
Administrative templates let us create custom Group Policy settings. Administrative template files have two different versions. Windows Vista introduced templates with the .ADMX extension. These templates use an XML syntax and can be a lot more difficult to decipher and create by hand.</description>

A Dockerfile (no file extension) is a definition file that will build and run a container. That container can be a simple Microsoft IIS web application or Python/Flask application or a simple build/reporting service. A definition file helps us with our operational tasks, especially when we are building services or scripts for the repeatable tasks we face on a daily basis.</description>

In this post, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to install Docker on Windows and run your first containers.
Docker allows developers building a specific functionality (and all of its dependencies) into a small reproducible environment. This has evolved over time by enabling the ability to create small microservices that do one thing and do it well.</description>

You can change people’s mindset but it just may take a little more effort.

      <description>The first post in this three-part series focused on gathering requirements before spending time coding. While it is not necessary, I recommend that everyone read part 1 (Gathering Requirements). Understanding and having clear “User Stories” outlining the intended purpose of a tool is crucial, especially as we move towards building our new tool.
Once our “User Stories” have been defined and agreed upon by all stakeholders, we then need to begin breaking them down into tasks.</description>

      <description>If you have worked in IT for any duration, I’m sure you have overheard or been asked to build a tool to complete X or Y. Creating tools with PowerShell is fun, but it can become daunting when you create a tool that does not meet its intended purpose. Without understanding the full requirements, you may waste time and energy on developing a tool that no one will use.
Creating tools with PowerShell to automate a manual process or to help an internal stakeholder accomplish a desired result, typically does not need to turn into a large initiative with a Project Manager or Project Management Office (PMO).</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;re not interested, well then why the hell are you here? You can see others that have participated here: https://github.com/adbertram/HowIWorkIT/blob/master/ThisIsHowIWork.md
Where are you located? First of all, my name is Josh Rickard and I&#39;m located in Columbia, Missouri. It sounds lame, but really it&#39;s a great little town.</description>

      <description>Today I decided to write another post regarding PowerShell and Qualys Vulnerability Management API. This post will focus on gathering information about your enrolled Asset Groups. You can find the complete script on GitHub: https://github.com/MSAdministrator/POSH-Guard/blob/master/Get-QualysAssetGroupInformation
We start of by opening up PowerShell ISE and using our handy &amp;ldquo;Snippet&amp;rdquo; shortcut:
We select the &amp;ldquo;Cmdlet (Advanced function) - complete&amp;rdquo; option in the &amp;ldquo;Snippet&amp;rdquo; context menu. Once we have our advanced function template, we then proceed by entering a name for our Qualys Asset Group function.</description>

      <description>I always mean to post more on my blog, but as life gets in the way and work keeps me busy, I always seem to push it to the back-burner. This time, I am hoping to make it stick as a regular routine.
To kick off my new-found motivation to blog more, I am starting a series of posts surrounding PowerShell and Qualys Vulnerability Management API.
To start this off, first I&amp;rsquo;m going to share some my basic steps with regards to authentication to Qualys VM API v1.</description>

      <description>Recently I gave a presentation at MORENet&amp;rsquo;s 2015 Annual Conference about &amp;ldquo;Securing Windows with Group Policy&amp;rdquo;. This presentation was part of their &amp;ldquo;Advanced&amp;rdquo; technology track, and really focused on looking at the current permission levels of your users and deciding if they really need those rights/permissions.
I hope some people find these slides useful or at least a good reference point. If you have any questions about these slides then please do not hesitate to contact me by leaving a comment below.</description>

      <description>I work for a University with a decentralized IT department: each college, division, department, etc maintains their users. As a security department who maintains QualysGuard, we were wanting each department to scan their own assets and re-mediate all vulnerabilities found in these scans based on the following policy:
Level 4 and Level 5 vulnerabilities must be re-mediated within 15 days Level 3 vulnerabilities must be re-mediated within 30 days Level 2 vulnerabilities must be re-mediated within the next semesters Level 1 vulnerabilities must be re-mediated whenever possible WIth this policy in mind, we began rolling out our QualysGuard service using the following methods.</description>

      <description>My wife and I saw CITIZENFOUR yesterday during a secret screening. If you have not had the chance to see this movie, please do so as soon as you can - it&amp;rsquo;s a great documentary! The only complaint I have about the film is that they do not explain Cryptography or Encryption for the &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; folks. When the film ended, I looked around and their were many non-technical people (including older individuals).</description>

      <description>Hardening your systems (Servers, Workstations, Applications, etc.) ensures that every system is secured in accordance to your organizations standards. Microsoft has a &amp;ldquo;Solution Accelerator&amp;rdquo; called Security Compliance Manager that allows System Administrators or IT Pro&amp;rsquo;s to create security templates that help harden their systems in a manageable, repeatable, way. In addition to SCM, you can build your own by using the standard MMC console and adding the Security Templates Snap-In to the console - this gives you a more refined configuration, but can be cumbersome.</description>

      <description>Recently, at work, I nominated myself to begin a &amp;ldquo;Windows Security&amp;rdquo; course for IT Professionals that I work with. Being a former IT Pro, and now part of our security department as an Incident Responder, I thought I would create a course surrounding security. So, i&amp;rsquo;m going to use my blog to layout my plans for this &amp;ldquo;Windows Security&amp;rdquo; course - which will hopefully be useful for others as well.</description>

      <guid>https://letsautomate.it/article/qualys-guard-qualys-in-a-university-environment/</guid>
      <description>The University I work for has began using Qualys for our Enterprise Vulnerability Scanning and so far it&amp;rsquo;s been well received. The problem is that every &amp;ldquo;College/School&amp;rdquo; maintains their own systems thus we are decentralized, which makes maintaining Reports/Scans/Maps/etc. very difficult.
Because I have not found many posts/articles focused on a decentralized environment I decided I would explain the way we are approaching this. This is all a work in progress - if you have any questions or ideas, please get a hold of me.</description>

      <description>Now we are going to install MDT 2013. This is a simple process but I wanted to show you anyways.
After you have downloaded MDT 2013 from Microsoft (See This Post)
When you first Launch the MDT 2013 Installer, you should see the following screen:
Click Next to Continue
Accept the License Agreement and click Next:
Choose the Location that you want MDT 2013 to be installed. This is typically left alone but you are more than welcome to install it on a separate partition/drive.</description>

      <description>Once you have all of the necessary files downloaded and saved on your Windows Server 2012 R2 box, then begin by installing the &amp;ldquo;adksetup.exe&amp;rdquo;.
The first screen that should pop-up is this one:
The Following Screenshots are all based on your own needs but these are the options that I have chosen for this setup:
I choose to download the ADK instead of installing it. The reason I do this is because I like to keep a backup of the original file, just in case the server crashes or something else happens.</description>

This will be similar to my MDT 2012 Update 1 Guide but a bit different as well. I hope you enjoy!

This applies to Windows 7 and I&amp;rsquo;m sure it could be modified to work with Windows 8.1. Check it out below and let me know if you have any questions.
To do this, you are going to need the following scripts in a folder on your MDT 2013 Server.</description>

      <description>I work for a large public University and we have many Resource Accounts. We needed a way to move from Public Folders but we wanted it to be seemless as possible. To do this, I created this VBS script that allows anyone to add Resource Accounts to their Outlook 2013/2010 calendar as a shared calendar. The user in question will have to run this script while Outlook is open and it will pull the Resource Account (add the Resource Account name in the RESOURCEACCOUNTNAME variable below) from the GAL and add it to the users calendar.</description>

It is actually pretty trivial to make this work, all you need to do is install a correctly formatted mobile config plist over the air from a web server.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of questions about my MDT 2012 Driver setup and hopefully this post will explain a little bit about it. Let me know if you have any questions
Personally I have a folder on my server called _Source_Drivers. I keep all my drivers here and import them into MDT but keep the original. Here is what my file structure of this folder looks like.
Once I have my structure setup I then begin to setup the structure on my MDT Deployment Share.</description>

I have created my new MDT 2012 Deployment Share and want to add Microsoft Office 2010 as an application, but I also need to customize that deployment of Office 2010 when I&amp;rsquo;m deploying my new OS. Here are the steps on how to do this, but also how to create a custom Office 2010 Install.
Once you&#39;ve setup everything for you OS, go to the Applications folder on your Deployment Share and right click&amp;gt;New Application Once there, put in the relavent information including where your resource CD is located.</description>

      <description>Completing the Deployment Share Configuration Now you have imported an OS (from source media) and some WinPE drivers, we can go ahead and complete the configuration of the Deployment Share. 6.1 Advanced Configuration The Advanced Configuration section of MDT consists of four separate areas although, we only use the Selection Profiles section for now. The rest are advanced topics which you can explore later! Advanced Configuration – Selection Profiles Created a single additional selection profile – “WinPE Drivers” and configured it to contain only the drivers which Windows PE will use.</description>

      <description>Creating a Sysprep &amp;amp; Capture Task Sequence The “Task Sequence” is the heart of the MDT deployment solution. It is a list of steps which need to be taken to successfully deploy an Operating System. Initially you need to create a “Sysprep and Capture” task sequence. Go ahead and do this now. You don’t need to worry too much about which choice of OS you make as it doesn’t matter.</description>

      <description>4. Importing an OS Image The Operating Systems section of MDT lists all of the Operating Systems which are available to deploy from a Deployment Share. The deployment itself is controlled by a Task Sequence but the operating system source files need to be available. Simply right-click on Operating Systems on the left and Import your Windows 7 source media from either DVD or a network share. If you are planning to deploy both 32 and 64 bit versions, import both!</description>

      <description>Device Driver Management 3.1 Obtaining Device Drivers for a Deployment In order to deploy a single image to multiple hardware types, MDT performs a “driver injection” during the OS load process. For this to work, any and all relevant drivers need to be imported into the deployment share in advance. Depending on the hardware vendor, the process for obtaining these drivers may vary but will generally involve going to the vendor website and downloading the drivers for specific hardware models.</description>

      <description>So I went to this conference awhile back and sat through a presentation. Not really interesting, but since I am new to the whole Linux world I thought I would pass this along. Here is a PowerPoint presentation explaining the difference&amp;rsquo;s between Windows and Linux commands, at least common ones. Enjoy!

      <description>If you work in an environment similar to my previous position, then you would know how often you hear certain complaints after upgrading people to new applications or Operating Systems. Well one of those complaints came from individuals that we upgraded to Office 2010. They were use to the option of opening up Excel Spreadsheets in separate windows, but in Office 2010 you can&amp;rsquo;t do this by default you have to make a few tweaks.</description>

      <description>So I had an issue awhile back that need to be rectified and the fix was to clean out temporary install files from the Sun/Java folder in User profiles. This had to be done on about 700 machines, so I created this little script that cleans out these files and pushed it out to via AD. I hope you enjoy&amp;hellip;..

      <guid>https://letsautomate.it/article/scripting-mount-printer-at-startup-script/</guid>
      <description>So I had to come up with a batch script that would allow the user (in a lab) to select the printer that they wanted to use during that login session. Pretty much this was placed in the startup folder on a few lab machines and every time someone would login (Deep Freeze Machines) it would ask them to select the printer that they wanted to print to. It worked pretty well, I hope someone makes use of it.</description>

      <description>So one crucial concept that every programmer that enjoys or endures Assembly Language programming is the concept of Binary arthimetic and their corresponding Hexadecimal values. Here is a great example that you can use to make sure that you understand their values and thus it will help you understand IP addressing as well.</description>
