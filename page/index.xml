      <description>My name is Josh Rickard and I am a creator and automator of things. I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced IT &amp;amp; DFIR (Digital Forensics &amp;amp; Incident Response) professional that loves to automate and release open-source tools to help the Information Security community.
I like long walks through binary trees, Python &amp;amp; PowerShell riding, writing romantic experiences about code, git prune all branches, and deep sea phishing.
