      <description>PowerShell is unique, but it is also necessary in today&amp;rsquo;s world. I find that newcomers to the language are sometimes confused or don&amp;rsquo;t understand the basic layers of PowerShell scripting. You can use PowerShell in different ways, but I have yet to find an all encompassing article that explains the high-level of how to interact with PowerShell in these ways.
This post will explain the main advantages and use cases of invoking PowerShell for newcomers to the language.</description>

      <description>I am currently migrating my blog content from Wordpress.com to GitHub pages using Hugo. During this transition, I wanted to have the ability to &amp;ldquo;revive&amp;rdquo; my blog posts on a scheduled basis on social media (e.g. Twitter). With Wordpress, you can use the WordPress Revive Old Posts plugin but with WordPress.com you have to have a premium business account to use plugins.
If you&amp;rsquo;re in a similar situation of if you want a free way to automate the &amp;ldquo;re-posting&amp;rdquo; of your blog content then you&amp;rsquo;re in luck!</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was asked to help with streamling a manual process that some QA folks were running into. They had a debug release of an applicaiton that was signed with a test code signing certificate. Part of the process was that they needed to select a DLL, view the certificate, and then install the certificate into the machines trusted certificate store.
This is a extremely simple task, but it was just an annoyance, so I wrote a few lines of code to autoamte this for them.</description>
