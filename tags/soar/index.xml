      <description>Alerts or detections come in many forms—some are good and some are not—and security operations center (SOC) analysts are responsible for the initial investigation into these anomalies. What’s more, when it comes to cloud-based resources, we may not have the luxury of logging everything that happens on a host operating system.
Microsoft Azure helps provide quite a bit of data to assist with the initial investigation, as well as some initial response actions.</description>

      <title>Swimlane and Cylance PROTECT: Endpoint Threat Response</title>

      <description>Swimlane and Blackberry Cylance have partnered to offer a new use case that combines the power of security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) with Cylance PROTECT’s integrated threat prevention solution. The Proactive Endpoint Threat Response use case utilizes our integration to take a proactive response to detections identified by Cylance PROTECT.
By ingesting detections from Cylance PROTECT, Swimlane can automate and orchestrate the enrichment of detections using multiple open source intelligence (OSINT) platforms to identify malicious files proactively that are similar or related to a specific variant identified by Cylance.</description>
