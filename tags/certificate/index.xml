      <description>Windows Certificate Store is typically accessed using the MMC Snap-In, You can view both the Computer or User certificate stores using a traditional MMC console. Sometimes though, you may just want to programmatically access it using PowerShell. Luckily you can do this using a PSDrive that is created on your machine.
As you can see there is a Cert drive and you can access it using PowerShell&amp;rsquo;s multiple location based Cmdlets.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was asked to help with streamling a manual process that some QA folks were running into. They had a debug release of an applicaiton that was signed with a test code signing certificate. Part of the process was that they needed to select a DLL, view the certificate, and then install the certificate into the machines trusted certificate store.
This is a extremely simple task, but it was just an annoyance, so I wrote a few lines of code to autoamte this for them.</description>
