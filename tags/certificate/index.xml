      <description>Yesterday I was asked to help with streamling a manual process that some QA folks were running into. They had a debug release of an applicaiton that was signed with a test code signing certificate. Part of the process was that they needed to select a DLL, view the certificate, and then install the certificate into the machines trusted certificate store.
This is a extremely simple task, but it was just an annoyance, so I wrote a few lines of code to autoamte this for them.</description>
