      <description>I recently transitioned my blog over to GitHub Pages from WordPress. I was using the free version from WordPress.org and I wanted more granular control over the layout. Additionally, I wanted to automate my blog publishing and social media notifications; the free version of WordPress didn&amp;rsquo;t meet my needs. So I looked around and eventually fell in love with Hugo! This post outlines how to go about setting up a GitHub Pages website/blog using Hugo.</description>

      <description>I am currently migrating my blog content from Wordpress.com to GitHub pages using Hugo. During this transition, I wanted to have the ability to &amp;ldquo;revive&amp;rdquo; my blog posts on a scheduled basis on social media (e.g. Twitter). With Wordpress, you can use the WordPress Revive Old Posts plugin but with WordPress.com you have to have a premium business account to use plugins.
If you&amp;rsquo;re in a similar situation of if you want a free way to automate the &amp;ldquo;re-posting&amp;rdquo; of your blog content then you&amp;rsquo;re in luck!</description>
